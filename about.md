Hello all and welcome to Site of the Kibojoe Linux <img src="http://manjaro-linux.com.br/forum/images/smilies/icon_e_biggrin.gif"> 

<p align="justify">So what is Kibojoe Linux? <strong>Kibo</strong> is one of three volcanic cones (the other two are Mawenzi and Shira) of Killimanjaro, the highest mountain/stratovolcano in Africa (Tanzania). We adopted the name <strong>joe</strong> from Joe Wingbermuehle, the creator and maintainer of <em>Joe's Window Manager</em> (JWM), wrote a window manager and called it JWM to run on the X window system. So paying tribute to Manjaro Linux and Joe, combine the name unto one, hence Kibojoe. The <a href="https://github.com/kibojoe/artwork-logo" target="_blank">logo</a> represents the union of the Manjaro with the JWM: i) the volcano (green color) and ii) the letter j represents the interior of the volcano and the cloud over it (blue color). Kibojoe Linux is an re-spin easy, fast, elegant and powerful. It's efficient, stable, modern, reliable and user-friendly GNU/Linux operating system. Kibojoe Linux is configured and optimized for it easily perform routine computing needs and activities of our day-to-day. It's incorporates the <em>Keep It Simple, Stupid</em> (KISS) philosophy, is rolling-release and compatible with all the the benefits of Manjaro Linux and ArchLinux. Created with "Manjaro-Tools" and always maintained collaboratively.</p>
