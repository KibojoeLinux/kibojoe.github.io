<p align="justify">JWM (Joe’s Window Manager) is a light-weight window manager for the X11 Window System. JWM is written in C and uses only Xlib at a minimum. Because of its small footprint, JWM makes a good window manager for older computers and less powerful systems, such as the Raspberry Pi, though it is perfectly capable of running on modern systems. JWM is included in small Linux distributions such as Puppy Linux and Damn Small Linux, and it is available as a separate package in many other distributions.</p>

Although JWM does not require them, it can use the following libraries if available: 

- libXext for the shape extension
- libXext for the render extension
- libXmu for drawing rounded windows (shape extension also needed)
- libXinerama for Xinerama (multi-monitor) support
- libXpm for XPM backgrounds and icons
- libjpeg for JPEG backgrounds and icons
- libpng for PNG backgrounds and icons
- libRSVG and Cairo for SVG backgrounds and icons
- libxft for antialiased and true type fonts
- libfribidi for right-to-left language support

JWM attempts to conform to the ICCCM and supports both MWM hints and Extended Window Manager Hints (EWMH).
